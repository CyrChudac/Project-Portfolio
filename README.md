### Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood scripting baseline
A lot of modding tools were created in 2024 for this old game. Within one of them possibility of custom scripts (in lua) was introduced. The original game scripts had to be recreated so that potential modders can use them as a code baseline. I made most of them.
